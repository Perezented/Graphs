Graph Terminology
_________________
Nodes / Vertexes, Vertices - -the data components of the graph
Edges - -the connections between Nodes

Directed - - One way edges
Undirected - - Multi way edges

Cyclic - - there is a 'loops'
Acyclic - - There is no loops

Dense Graph - - high ratio of edges to nodes
Sparce Graph - - high ratio of nodes to edges

Weighted - - edges have associated weights
Unweighted - - edges do not, are all the same weights

Breadth - First Traversal:
init: add startign node to the queue

while queue is not empty:
    deque a node
    if visited, ignore it
    else:
        add all nodes neighbors to
        mark node as visited
